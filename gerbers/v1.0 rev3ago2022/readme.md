# **RaSCSI Reloaded THT PCB by MrGasS aka S.E.M.M.**  
  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Revision**: 3ago2022  
**Based on**: RaSCSI Reloaded v2.4 FullSpec 68kmla Version  
**Testing status:** ~~fully tested and working.~~

## 31/10/2022: ISSUES DISCOVERED, PLEASE READ ME!
While the protos from April are working perfectly, I encountered some problems with this version of the board (1.0 rev3ago2022), specifically it doesn't work with a Macintosh IIsi and I'm trying to figure out where the problem is.  
Please, avoid printing this board for now, as I'm still analyzing the scheme and the KiCad project against the printed PCB.  
If everything will be solved, this text will be cutted and an update will be published, or maybe you'll see a new 1.1 version of the board.  
I'm sorry, I'll try to solve this bullshit as soon as possible.
